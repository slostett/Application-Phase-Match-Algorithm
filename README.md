# Application-Phase-Match-Algorithm
Algorithm used by UNC School of Medicine to match students to campuses.

This is a simulation of the algorithm currently used by UNC School of Medicine administration to match 190 students to campuses for their third year. 

I designed and created the algorithm independently. After presenting to the deans, a similar algorithm was adopted and is now used.

I recommend running it in the Colab for best results.
